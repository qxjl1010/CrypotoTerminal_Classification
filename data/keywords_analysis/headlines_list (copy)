RT @naval: Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.
RT @naval: Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.
RT @naval: Youre not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.
RT @naval: You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.
RT @naval: Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.
RT @naval: The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.
RT @naval: Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.
@naval And compounding impact.
RT @naval: Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.
RT @naval: Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.
RT @naval: Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.
RT @naval: Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.
@naval Ikigai.
RT @naval: Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.
